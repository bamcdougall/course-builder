<h1>List of Modules and Extensions</h1>



Course Builder accomodates certain modules and extensions that extend its capability but are not packaged natively with it. The following sections list those modules and extensions as well as the locations to download them. The locations themselves will have directions on how to install them.

## Modules ##
The module listed below must follow the convention described in [Create Custom Modules](CreateModules.md) and be placed in the `modules/` directory.

  * [Khan Academy Exercises](https://github.com/psimakov/khan-exercises-coursebuilder). This module lets you embed Khan Academy Exercises in your Course Builder course. You have instant access to over 400 existing exercises and can add your own. See [Khan Academy Exercises](http://www.softwaresecretweapons.com/jspwiki/khan-academy-exercises-in-course-builder) for more information.

  * [XBlock Module](https://github.com/google/coursebuilder_xblock_module). Enables [edX](https://www.edx.org/) [XBlocks](https://github.com/edx/XBlock) to create and present course content in Course Builder. This module uses the [XBlock Runtime](https://github.com/google/appengine_xblock_runtime) library for Google App Engine.


## Extensions ##

  * [Instant Hangout](https://github.com/google/instant-hangouts). Adds Google+ Hangouts to any page. Only requires two lines of code to implement this feature. By default, the button will display the Hangout name and information about the participants, rather than just a button to start a new Hangout.
