<h1>Accessibility</h1>



Accessibility means making products that work for everyone. More specifically, “Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including older people with changing abilities due to aging (W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative).”

The following are some elements in Course Builder to facilitate accessibility:

  * ARIA landmarks (attributes that you can add to elements to help assistive technologies interact and navigate web pages)
  * Contextual page titles
  * Heading tags
  * Label attributes
  * Skipping to main content
  * Title attributes
