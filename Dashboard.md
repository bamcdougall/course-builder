<h1>Dashboard</h1>



The Dashboard shows a broad range of information about a particular course. Information in the Dashboard includes the course outline, settings, student statistics, and translations. You must be the course author or have similar privileges (for example, teacherâ€™s assistant) to access the Dashboard. Access different parts of the Dashboard from the menu on the left.

## Create ##
The **Create** pages are where you can start building and editig your course. By default you will land on the **Outline** page. The outline is ordered and structured exactly the way students see it. Each hyperlink goes to the corresponding course page.

  * _Import_. Import settings and data from another course on the same Google App Engine instance. For example, you can import the example Power Searching course into your newly made course. This button is only available if your course is completely empty.
  * _Add Assessment_. Create new assessments directly online through the assessment editor. See [Writing Assessments](CreateAssessments#Writing_assessments.md) for more information on creating and editing courses.
  * _Add Link_. Add a URL into your course. The URL can be relative to your course URL or in can be an absolute URL.
  * _Add Unit_. Create new units. The newly created units show in the **Course Outline** section.

Create your questions and question groups in **Create > Questions**. Use labels in the **Labels** page to allow your students to take particular tracks or paths through your course as opposed to taking the entire course.

Upload images and documents you want to use in your course in the **Images & documents** page. This saves the file in Google App Engine datastore, which may be more expensive to host compared to statically hosting elsewhere.

In the **Roles** page, create, manage, and view different roles for your course. You can associate created roles with particular emails and permissions. Currently, the role is limited to a translator role.

## Style ##
These pages show all the elements that are used to style your course.

  * **CSS.** Pathname to the inherited CSS. You can make changes here, by clicking **Override**, and they will propagate to all your courses.
  * **JavaScript.** Pathname to the inherited JavaScript libraries. You can make changes here, by clicking **Override**, and they will propagate to all your courses.
  * **HTML.** Pathname to any inherited HTML files.
  * **Templates.** Pathname to the inherited HTML templates. You can make changes here, by clicking **Edit**, and they will propagate to all your courses.
  * **Extensions.** List of any custom extensions you added.

## Publish ##
Use the **Search** page to enable search and reindex your course when you enter new content. Before you can retrieve results from a search through the Search box, you must index your course. Choose the appropriate option to index your course. When you first index a new course, it does not matter which indexing method you select. Search will not cover results that are in sections marked "Private". It will also search over user created captions but not over automatically created captions.

Use the **Translations** page to translate your pages.
## Manage ##
These pages show Peer review information and statistics regarding the students and the course, including individual questions, assessments, gradebook, notifications, and peer review.  Each section has its own sub-navigation item.

  * **Students.** Shows information about students in aggregate including progress and enrollment.
  * **Questions.** How students in aggregate interacted with each question in the course.
  * **Assessments.** How students in aggregate performed on the assessments.
  * **Gradebook.** How students in aggregate performed on the assessments. The Gradebook only works for questions authored on Course Builder version 1.3.0 or later.  Therefore, it will not work if you import and modify the example Power Searching with Google course, since that course was authored in version 1.0.
  * **Certificates Earned.** How many students earned certificates. You must specify the certificate requirements in **Dashboard > Course > Certificate criteria**.
  * **Data Pump.** Create custom analysis that are not natively supported in Course Builder by sending data to [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/). See [Data Pump Configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ticBJcZGZ8) to see how to setup Course Buiilder and your instance to interface with BigQuery. Next see [Running Data Pump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz80K9DPtxg) to understand how to send data to BigQuery.
  * **Notifications.** Number of people who have been notified via email by a currently registered student.
  * **Peer Review.** See bar charts showing the number of assignments with a particular number of reviews.  You can also reassign reviews and delete reviewed assignments.

Remember that if you want to see progress on activities, you must turn on the activity recording setting in **Site admin > Site settings** by selecting the following items to `True`:
  * Record activities
  * Record page events
  * Record tag events

The **Update Statistics** button will refresh all statistics on the page. Note that the time it takes to update depends on the number of students you have.

## Settings ##
Settings shows how your course is customized in the `course.yaml` file described in [Customize Course Settings](CourseSettings.md). Sub-navigation tabs divide the Settings into logical groups.

  * **Course.** Settings that affect your entire course including making it public or private. You can also set whether to generate certificates for your students by setting percentage correct for any number of assessments you choose. Percentage correct can either by any positive number, for example 90% or 89.9%.
  * **Homepage.** Control details that affect your course homepage.
  * **Registration.** Control registration and student invitations.
  * **Units and Lessons.** Control unit, lesson, and assessment presentation.
  * **Translations.** Control internationalization settings like the base locale and whether students can change the locale if there is more than one.
  * **Advanced.** See and edit the contents of the `course.yaml` file directly. Caution: be careful editing this section. We suggest you use the other Setting pages instead. YAML uses whitespace and line delimiters. Introducing errant spaces can make your entire course unreachable.
  * **Preferences.** Set whether you want to see hook edit buttons or the Jinja context.  Hooks edits are custom text, links, or graphics you can add to the HTML itself, in defined parts of the page, through the browser. This elminates the need to edit the HTML directly while manually making sure those changes are carried forward on Course Builder upgrades.
