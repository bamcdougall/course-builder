<h1>Create Questions</h1>
Course Builder separates the writing of questions with activities and assessments. This facilitates question management in that you can see a list of all questions that you will ask for a course, reuse questions, separate the responsibilities of writing informational content versus question content, etc.



## Write Questions in the Dashboard ##
Under **Create > Questions** there are two sections related to question management: **Question Bank**, where you write your questions and **Question Groups**, where you can optionly group your questions and add them in an activity or assessment in one batch.

Create your questions here first and then import them when you are crafting your assessments and activities.

## Question Types ##
The Questions page lists all the questions you created and are available to import into your assessments and activities. You can add two types of questions: Short Answer and Multiple Choice.

Short answer questions are those questions in which correct answers require textual input from the student.

  * **Question:** Type your question in this text box.
  * **Description:** Write a description for this question. This is how you will identify your question in the Question Bank and when you import this question in an assessment or activity.
  * **Hint:** This field is optional. If you want to give your students a hint on how to solve the problem, put that in this text box.
  * **Feedback:** This field is optional. This text is shown when the student response does not match the answer.
  * **Rows:** The number of rows for the input field for student answers.
  * **Columns:** The number of columns for the input field for students answers.
  * **Score:** The numerical score for this question.
  * **Grading:** The type of response the correct answer will be: `Case insensitive string match`, `Regular expression`, and `Numeric`.
  * **Response:** Type the correct answer for this question here.
  * **Feedback:** This field is optional. Type any feedback you want associated with the correct answer.

Multiple choice questions ask students to choose a correct answer among a group of answer choices. You can add as many answer choices as you like. Course Builder offers many different ways to control your mulitple choice questions.

  * **Question:** Type your question in this text box.
  * **Description:** Write a description for this question. This is how you will identify your question in the Question Bank and when you import this question in an assessment or activity.
  * **Selection:** The default selection, `Allow only one selection`, allows only one correct answer. The `Allow multiple selections` option allows you to specify multiple correct answers.
  * **Assign scores to individual choices | Return to choice picker view:** You can weight the answers by selecting `Assign scores to individual choices`. For example, you may want to give "partial credit" for close but still incorrect answers or in multiple correct answer scenarios weight the correct answers separately.
  * **Rich Text:** Click this button if you want to type your answers in Rich Text. For example, if you wan to bold your text in the Rich Text editor, you would only need to click a button. By default the textbox accepts HTML.
  * **Show feedback:** Click this button to type feedback for a particular answer choice.
  * **Add a choice:** Add additional answer choices.

## Question Groups ##
Question groups allow you to "package" questions together. You may want to do this for organizational purposes or to input similar questions together in an assessment or activity.

  * **Description:** Write a description for this Question Group. This is how you will identify your Question Group when you import this question in an assessment or activity.
  * **Introduction:** This field is optional. Write an introduction, leading paragraph, or description that will precede your Question Group.
  * **Weight:** This is a required field. Add how you want to weight the question relative to the other questions in the group.
  * **Question:** Add the question from the Question Bank. Note you can order the questions using the up and down arrows.
  * **Delete item:** Delete a particular question from the Question Group.
