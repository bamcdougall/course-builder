# Online Office Hours #

You create most of your course material, the [lessons](CreateLessons.md), [assessments](CreateAssessments.md), and [activities](CreateActivities.md), prior to the start of the course. During the course, you primarily communicate with your students asynchronously, through email, web forums, your Google+ page, or your blog.

Another way you may choose to communicate with your students is with online office hours. As with any course, your students appreciate having their questions answered by live instructors. You can enable this with Google Hangouts or Hangouts On Air. These mechanisms allow you to interact with your students in real-time.

A **[Google Hangout](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/)** is a video chat that can take up to 10 video participants (you plus nine others). In a Hangout, you can talk with the other participants and even share your computer screens. If your audience is very small, this is a lovely way to interact. If  you anticipate a much larger audience, you can use a Hangout On Air instead of a normal Hangout.

A **[Hangout On Air](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html)** lets you broadcast a normal Hangout to the rest of the world, by broadcasting it on your Google+ page and your YouTube channel. During the Hangout, people around the world can watch the Hangout. They will not be able to directly contribute (the 10-person limitation still exists for interaction over video). The hangout is recorded as a public video. You can then edit and share the recorded hangout for posterity. Consider having a Hangout on Air once per week during your course.

## Setting up a Hangout On Air ##

Hangouts On Air are a very effective way of broadcasting a live event to a large audience. Keep in mind, however, that they take a bit of effort to organize. See [Google+ Hangouts On Air](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fservices.google.com%2Ffh%2Ffiles%2Fblogs%2FHangouts_On_Air_Technical_Guide.pdf&amp;ei=_AobUPSmDcH7igKT7IDQCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQeYbIaw3r8BgomjusXFYH9XIycg&amp;sig2=F0tnm46dn5vUVnAVIf5pDw) for step-by-step instructions for organizing one.

### Some tips ###

  * You must have a Google account, a Google+ account, and a YouTube channel to organize a Hangout On Air. See [Create your YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/create_channel).
  * The URL for a  Hangout On Air becomes available only when you actually start it. That means that you cannot publicize the URL ahead of time.
  * Instead, publicize either the URL for your YouTube channel or the URL for your Google+ page. When your Hangout On Air starts, it will be visible at the top of those two locations.
  * Your audience may include hearing impaired people. Additionally, non-native speakers of the language of your Hangout On Air may be more comfortable reading your language than hearing it spoken. For these reasons, consider having a transcriptionist create captions in real-time for your Hangout On Air. (See [What is Hangout Captions?](https://hangout-captions.appspot.com/) for more information.)
