<h1>Work with Video</h1>

It is outside the scope of this documentation to tell you how to create video. We do have a few general tips that may make your life easier:

  * **In general**
    * Just be warned that creating a video takes a long time to do well. Leave ample time in your schedule for initial filming, editing, and any necessary refilming and reediting.

  * **Prior to filming**
    * Solidify the course objectives, assessments, and activities prior to filming.
    * Create the text version of all lessons prior to filming.
    * Basically, wait to film until everything else is done. Fixing video problems takes much longer than fixing textual problems.

  * **During filming**
    * Run through live demos quickly prior to recording.
    * Record separate feeds of the presenter and any computer material.
    * Have as many content creators present during filming as possible (in order to catch any issues so they can be reshot on the spot).

  * **Captioning**
    * Consider adding captions to your videos to help the hearing impaired and to help students who are not natives speakers of the language used in your videos. See [How to create captions and subtitles on YouTube](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=100079).
    * Remember that edits may change the captions. Look into having someone clean up the captions.

  * **Editing**
    * Have a clear edit request process with deadlines for feedback and edits.
    * Maintain up-to-date documentation of edits requested and completed, including the state of the edits: edited, exported, compressed, uploaded, and other relevant information.
    * Collect as many edit requests as possible before beginning the editing process, and only complete the production cycle (through uploading) when absolutely necessary.
    * Have someone committed to going through the final videos and uploads to double check everything.

Once you have created your videos, you need to post them to the Internet to make them available to students. If you decide to post your videos on YouTube, you may be interested in the following information:
