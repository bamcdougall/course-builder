<h1>Example TA Essentials Doc</h1>

If you do nothing else for your TAs to get them prepared, have at least one session in which you introduce them to the course and to what their responsibilities will be throughout. This page is an example template for information you should cover in that session.

</li><li>If you don’t know the answer, but will own and help pursue it, things are a little more complicated?<br>
<ul><li>Reply back "Thanks for your good question.  I’ll research this and get back to you." Add a star to the message, which means "escalation in progress."<br>
