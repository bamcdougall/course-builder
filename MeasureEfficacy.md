# Evaluate Course Efficacy #

You probably want to be able to evaluate the difference you have made with your course and have concrete information to guide future improvement of it. To do so, you need to collect and analyze data of various sorts.

Deciding early on what analyses you want to do makes it more likely that, as you continue to develop the course, you remember to collect the information necessary to do those analyses. Do not wait until after the course has launched; it may well be too late by then.

There are three basic categories of data that we suggest using. Not all are relevant to all courses. Depending on your content and on the course objectives, you may use any, all, or even none of these categories of data.

| **Type** |  **To measure** | **Examples** | **How to collect** |
|:---------|:----------------|:-------------|:-------------------|
| **Assessments** | Student skill level and improvement in ability | What percentage of students scored at least 30 points higher on the post-course assessment than on the pre-test? <br>What percentage of students missed questions around a particular topic? <table><thead><th> Take snapshots of students' ability at various times. For example, administer pre-, mid-, and post-course assessments. <br>For more information, see <a href='AssessmentMetrics.md'>Student Assessments</a>. </th></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> <b>Reach and engagement</b> </td><td> How many people you reached with the course and how engaged those people were </td><td> How many students registered? <br> How many completed each unit and each lesson?  <br>What countries did the students come from? <br> What were the overall drop-off rates?  <br>When did students tend to drop off? </td><td> Use Google Analytics. <br>For more information, see <a href='ReachAndEngagementMetrics.md'>Reach and Engagement</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Happiness</b> </td><td> Student attitudes towards the material and feelings of satisfaction </td><td> How satisfied were the students with what they learned? <br> Do they think they will be able to use the material? <br> Did they enjoy the course? <br> Did they feel well supported by their peers? <br>Did they feel well supported by the instructors? </td><td> Send a post-course survey to everyone who registered for your course.  Consider sending different surveys to people who registered but didn't finish the course from those who did finish it.<br>For more information, see <a href='HappinessMetrics.md'>Student Happiness</a>. </td></tr></tbody></table>

<h2>General tips</h2>
<ul><li>Consider that with a truly massive course, the raw number of students who complete the course may be more useful than the rate of completion compared to the number of registered participants. If 150,000 people registered for your course  and you only had a 5% completion rate, that is still 7,500 people who completed your course. 7,500 is a lot of people, even if it is a small percentage.</li></ul>

<ul><li>If you're concerned with how well your material works for an international audience, figure out the completion ratio by country. Assume 80% of the people from your country completed the course, but only 5% of people from other countries. That might indicate that your material is less effective for people from other cultures.</li></ul>

<ul><li>During the course, collect data as you go, recording all of it in a centralized location.</li></ul>

<ul><li>If time is limited (and it will be), prioritize which data and analyses you need immediately, and which ones can wait.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Is a pre- and post-course assessment comparison needed?</li></ul>

<ul><li>Assuming you have a team of people working on your course, split the evaluation work among several people. If possible, have a different person be responsible for each of the categories above. Data collection and analysis takes time, and it helps to have the many team members think through what’s needed and how you analyze it.</li></ul>

<ul><li>If you have not done evaluations of this sort before, keep in mind that working with and analyzing data takes time and practice. The amount of data you collect may seem overwhelming and it will require time for analysis. If you know people who are comfortable in this area, reach out to them. In general, you’ll find that people are very eager to share their expertise!</li></ul>
