<h1>Create Skill Maps</h1>



Skill maps help increase the effectiveness and efficiency of student learning. They enable both goal-directed activities and goal-directed content navigation. When goals are explicitly communicated to learners, they guide their practice and help them monitor their progress. Goal-directed content navigation enables meta cognition and you can interpret it as proxy for learning.

We use the term "skill" to define knowledge about procedures, processes, facts, and concepts that can be tested. It is a piece of knowledge that can be measured or assessed. A skill can have one or more prerequisite skills.

## Create Skills ##
You can approach creating skills two ways:
  1. Enumerate the skills you want to teach in your course before creating your course.
    1. Go to **Create > Skills table.
  1. Click**Create New Skill**1. Type the name of the skill in the Skill field.
  1. Type the skill's description in the Description field.
  1. Add any prerequisites for this skill. Prerequisites are other skills that should be learned before attempting to learning the current skill.
  1. Optionally map this skill to a lesson or lessons.**

  1. Create your course and then create skills to map to your lessons.
    1. Go to **Create > Outline**
  1. Click on a lesson onto which you want to map a skill or skills.
  1. In the Skills field, click **Add Skill** if you have already created a skill or **Create New Skill** to create the skill at this time.
  1. Click **Save**.
  1. Click **Close**. You will see your skill mapped to the lesson in **Dashboard > Outline** under the Skills column.

You can also do a hybrid approach where you combine the two ways in whichever manner you choose.

## See the Skills Graph ##
To see your skill graph, go to **Create > Skills Graph**.

A skill map is a directed acyclic graph, G=(V,E), of skills and dependency relationships. Skills are modeled as nodes, V, and dependencies are modeled as directed edges, E, from prerequisites to follow-up skills.

## See Student's Perspective of Skills ##
View a lesson, from the student's perspective, in which you added a skill. At the top of the lesson you will see the skill(s) taught in the lesson and any prerequisites.

## Students See Their Own Skills Competency ##
It is important for students to see their own progress on skills. They can do so by going to their **Progress** tab and viewing the **Skills Progress** section. Here they can see the skills taught in the course and how they are proceeding with those skills with the Proficiency level chart. Higher proficiencies are darker colored. Students can also see what skills are recommended next.
