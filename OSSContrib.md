<h1>Open Source Contributions</h1>

We made Open Source contributions outside of Course Builder, including:

  * [edX Third-Party Authentication](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/tree/master/common/djangoapps/third_party_auth)  A third-party authentication module to Open edX. With it, your users can sign in to your Open edX deployment with external identity providers like Google, LinkedIn, or University Single Sign-On (SSO) systems. The module is disabled by default, supplements rather than replaces first-party authentication, and was designed to be extensible and testable.

  * [Google App Engine XBlock Runtime](https://github.com/google/coursebuilder_xblock_module) A library that provides an XBlock runtime environment, which uses the Google App Engine datastore. [cbX](cbx.md) uses this library.

  * [Realtime Help Chat XBlock](https://github.com/google/realtime-help) The Realtime Help XBlock (together with a notification service) enables students to ask other students for help in realtime. Authors of edX courses can add this XBlock to a course page. When a student is stuck on a problem, he/she can type a question into this XBlock, which will then be broadcast to other students taking the course. The recipients of the broadcast can then join the original studentâ€™s chat room, and help him/her to address the problem.
