# Reach and Engagement #

Evaluating the reach and engagement of your course lets you determine how many people you reached with the course and how engaged those people were. **Reach** refers to how many people visited your course, while **engagement** can refer to how long each person stayed on each page and how many pages each person visited.

Some common questions on reach and engagement include:

  * How many students registered?
  * How many completed each unit and each lesson?
  * What countries did the students come from?
  * How many students are new versus returning students?
  * What are the most popular pages?
  * What were the overall drop-off rates?
  * When did students tend to drop-off?

For suggestions on data you can use to measure reach and engagement, see [Example Reach & Engagement Data](ExampleReachEngagementMetrics.md).

For an example of how to use student assessments and reach and engagement data to evaluate your course's effectiveness, see [Combine Assessment and Reach Data](AnalyticsForEdu.md).

## Google Analytics ##
Google Analytics is our tool for collecting and analyzing reach and engagement data. The [Analytics site](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/index.html) contains a lot of useful information. Start with [Get started with Google Analytics.](http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1008015&topic=1726909&ctx=topic) This step-by-step guide describes how to get an Analytics account to use with your course.

To collect Analytics data, specify your Google Analytics Tracking ID as the value for the `google_analytics_id` setting in your [course.yaml](CourseSettings.md) file.

Remember to convey your privacy policy to students and let them know that they will be tracked on metrics you wish to measure.
