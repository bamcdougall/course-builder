<h1>Develop the Content without Technology</h1>

After you have taken a few minutes to [plan](OnePlan.md), it’s time to start developing. It’s extremely tempting to just dive in and start recording videos and writing assessments and so on. But if you do that, you can create a course that doesn’t make sense and that doesn’t satisfy your problem statement, high-level goal, or any of the supplementary objectives you planned. That said, even though we recommend you do initial development without using the technology, there are aspects of the final delivery method that should influence your development strategy.

In the first parts of development you expand on the information you determined during the planning phase. After that, you decide precisely what you want students to learn and how you’ll get them to do that:



## Clarify your goals and non-goals for the course. ##

This is an expansion of what you did in the planning step, but at a more detailed level. For example:

  * The primary goal is to teach beginning knitters how to knit a pullover sweater in a single color.
  * A subgoal is to teach them how to shape pieces of a garment.
  * Another subgoal is to teach them how to accurately determine how large a garment will be.
  * It is not a goal to teach them how to knit a sweater using 10 different colors.
  * It is not a goal to teach them how to make buttonholes.

## Clarify your assumptions about your students. ##

Again, this is an expansion of what you did in the planning step. For example:

  * Students will already know how to knit a scarf.
  * They will know how to cast yarn on and off needles and will know how to do both a knit stitch and a purl stitch.

If your course truly is “massive”, the number of students guarantees an audience diversity that you may not expect. It can be difficult to balance how much allowance to make for that diversity. If you expect an international audience, you need to clarify any differences in the content for audiences from different cultures.

For example, people in different communities hold knitting needles differently and consequently do the basic stitches differently. Will you teach only the method you use? Will you teach multiple methods?

Whatever you decide, in an open online course you should consider explicitly telling your students that what you will teach is only one way (or a few ways) to do or know whatever it is, and that there are other ways. Include links so students can read more, and even suggest that students discuss these alternative approaches in the forum.

Obviously, it is up to you what you expect students to know ahead of time and how you design your course based on those expectations. Some people design for the least knowledgeable students; others for the most knowledgeable. Or, given the almost guaranteed diversity of your students, you may design for that average. No matter who you design for, consider the following things that can help different students:

  * Remind students that they can replay the videos or even skip them.
  * Remind students that they can repeat activities as many times as they like.
  * Have text versions of the lessons. This is key, especially when many of your students are not native speakers of your language.
  * Find a way to provide extra, more challenging questions for advanced students. Placing optional questions in the forum is one approach.
  * Find a way to provide background material for students who might need a little extra help getting started. Putting background material in a Google+ post is one approach.

## Write clear, specific objectives. ##

Objectives accomplish two important things:

  * They tell the audience what they are going to learn. Clear objectives answer the “What’s in it for me?” question.
  * They also keep the content concise and specific. This lets you avoid overwhelming your students with too much information.

Objectives narrow down the information and keep it specific to the students' needs. For example:

  * At the end of this course, students will be able to choose the right needle size for the yarn, so that they will know how to gauge the size of a garment.
  * Students will be able to increase and decrease the number of stitches on a row, so that they can make shaped garments.

In deciding the objectives for your course, try to design for the middle ground. Don’t make the primary objectives either too easy or too hard. If there is advanced material you think would be great for some of your students, design so that that information is optional. If there is background information that you think some students may need, again make it optional.

## Decide what you want to assess in your assessments, both graded and ungraded. ##

  * In software development, this idea is known as test-driven development. The idea is to be very concrete about the outcome you want. “Students will know the answers to this set of questions.” You then create the lessons so that they enable that outcome.

  * Assessments serve multiple purposes. They let you assess students’ knowledge so that you can rate their progress, but also so that you can improve the course content for future versions.

  * Make your assessments compelling and challenging but not daunting or frustrating. You want the assessment to assess students’ progress, not to scare them away from the rest of the course.

  * Remember that your audience may have a wide range of familiarity with the online world. <br>Make sure that the mechanics of doing the assessments does not interfere with the content of the assessments. You want to assess the content, not how facile a student is with opening browser windows or using different types of user interface.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Decide whether or not you want graded assessments at all. <br>If you do want them, keep in mind that grading matters to students. Once you’ve said you will grade them, students want to know how the grading works and they will care passionately about getting a high grade. Once a deadline passes, you will hear from students who missed that deadline.</li></ul>

  * Assuming you want graded assessments, decide how those assessments affect the final grade. <br>For example, assume you have two graded assessments, one in the middle of the course and one at the end of the course. If you count the first assessment as 35% of the final grade, the final assessment as 65% of the grade, and you require at least a 70% combined score to pass the course, then if a student misses the deadline for the mid-course assessment, that student cannot pass the course. Is that what you want? And are you ready for the reaction from students that that decision entails?</li></ul>

<ul><li>Don’t even think about reusing assessments from one iteration of the course to another if scores matter to you.<br>Once the course goes live for the first time, its content, including the assessments, is on the web. People will repost and share them. If you give the course again, many of the students may have already seen the assessments from the last time you taught the course.</li></ul>

## Decide what other data to collect to evaluate your course's efficacy. ##

You should collect data so that you can evaluate the difference you have made with your course and so you can have concrete information to guide future improvement of your course. We collect three categories of data for these purposes:

  * **Assessments**, as discussed above, measure skill level and improvement in ability. <br><br>You collect this data by creating the pre-, mid-, and post-course assessments and comparing students' scores on them. See <a href='AssessmentMetrics.md'>Student Assessments</a>.</li></ul>

  * **Reach and engagement** data measures how many people you reached with the course and how engaged those people were. <br><br>Common reach and engagement data includes: How many students registered? How many completed each unit and each lesson?  What countries did the students come from? Was there a difference in course performance based on location? <br><br>You can collect this data by using <a href='ReachAndEngagementMetrics.md'>Google Analytics</a> to track visitors to your course.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Happiness</b> data measures student attitudes towards the material and feelings of satisfaction. They answer questions such as how satisfied the students were with what they learned and whether they think they will be able to use the material.<br><br>While not objective, happiness data is an important indicator of the success of your course. Even if a course was objectively effective, if your students hated it, they are not likely to recommend it to their friends. <br><br>You can collect happiness data by sending a post-course survey to everyone who registered for your course.  Consider sending different surveys to people who registered but didn't finish the course from those who did finish it. See <a href='HappinessMetrics.md'>Student Happiness</a>.</li></ul>

Deciding early on what data you want to evaluate makes it more likely that as you continue to the develop the course, you will remember to collect the information necessary to do those evaluations. Do not wait until after the course has launched; it may well be too late by then. For more information, see <a href='MeasureEfficacy.md'>Evaluate Course Efficacy</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Sequence and organize your content into digestible chunks.</h2>

Some things to consider during this step:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>During your first lesson, consider making it clear to students what the <a href='CourseFlow.md'>course flow</a> will be. Tell them when units will be released, what deadlines exist, during what hours course staff will be monitoring the discussion forum, and so on.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Is there an overall flow to the material that makes logical sense? What dependencies are there in your content? Are there steps that students must learn before other steps? Are there concepts that they must understand?</li></ul>

<ul><li>Even though you think your content has a logical flow from beginning to end, remember that people typically jump around online material. As much as possible, make each of your lessons standalone so that students can successfully access them in a different order than you anticipated.</li></ul>

<ul><li>To help with the last point, be consistent in lesson format. For example, first define the topic of the lesson, then say why it's important, give a demonstration of the topic, talk about it a bit, and finish with another demonstration and a short conclusion.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Consider having most lessons be of approximately the same size so your students know what to expect. For online consumption, your material should be in smaller chunks than for live classes. Keep videos 3-5 minutes in length.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Your videos can talk about fairly complex notions. If they do, be sure to back them up in other ways. For example, add tips before the activities and have multiple activities that point out the differences that cause the complexity.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Because community is such an important part of an online course, consider putting hooks into your discussion forum from your lessons. For example, have students do an open activity and post the results to the forum, to discuss with other students.</li></ul>

<ul><li>As discussed above, you should design the primary objectives for your course for the "average" student. You may still want to have optional material available for students who require extra background material and for students who would like extra challenging material. Do not put this optional material in the course lessons. Instead, consider putting this material in other formats; see <a href='Announcements#Optional_course_material,_in_a_web_forum,_blog,_or_Google+_page.md'>Announcements and Optional Material</a>.</li></ul>

A lot of your development time is spent in this step. For details on one way to create a detailed outline, see <a href='ObjectivesToOutline.md'>From Objectives to Outline</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Validate your content with others.</h2>

<ul><li>Before you go to the effort of writing text, recording video, and adding activities and assessments into Course Builder, check with others that what you plan to teach will accomplish your goals.</li></ul>

<ul><li>It’s best if you can check both with experts in the area (to make sure you don’t have any mistakes) and with representatives of your audience (to make sure what you have makes sense to them).</li></ul>

<ul><li>It can be hard to remember what not knowing something feels like, especially if you are an expert on the topic. This is why it’s so important to validate your content with representatives of your audience. You and the people who help you create a course know too much about it.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Keep your content legal. This may sound obvious, but laws for what you can do in a live classroom can be different from what you can do online. Also, laws regarding what you can show in a video or talk about in an online forum vary from country to country.<br>
Once you’ve developed your content (see <a href='ObjectivesToOutline.md'>From Objectives to Outline</a> for more guidance), it’s time to move on to <a href='ThreeImplement.md'>implementing the course with technology</a>.</li></ul>
