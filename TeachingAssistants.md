<h1>Teaching Assistants</h1>

Whenever you teach a course, you need to decide if you want teaching assistants (TAs) to help you work with your students. The primary goal of TAs is to help students feel well-supported by humans throughout the course. This is also true for online courses. The feeling of support your students get from the availability of real, knowledgeable humans to answer their questions can greatly improve their motivation and, ultimately, the success of your course.

TAs can help you carry out course administrative tasks, communicate with students and encourage their participation, and assist them whenever they get stuck on technology or course-related questions.

**Will you need TAs?** Consider the number of students you anticipate for your course. If you have fewer than 50, you may be able to handle being both instructor and TA yourself, if you have the time.  If you anticipate hundreds of students, we highly recommend finding a TA to help with course communication.  And if you anticipate thousands of students, depending on the nature of the content and how often you anticipate students getting stuck learning course material, you may want to consider a pool of several TAs. In case you decide to have a pool of TAs, this page provides tips on how to work with and support them.



Probably the most important tip is to take care of the well-being of the TA team. If you make them feel comfortable and supported, they will make your students feel comfortable and supported.

## TA responsibilities ##

How much you want your TAs to do can vary. The primary responsibilities are typically:

  * Moderate the forum. Provide encouragement, answer questions, and delete spam.
  * Moderate comments on Google+ page posts.
  * Escalate questions to more qualified folk as needed.
  * Collect commonly-asked questions into an FAQ document.

Additionally, consider using your TAs to pilot and to test the course content before it goes live. This is not a common TA duty for live courses, but can be quite effective for an online course.

## Staffing and coverage ##

  * Consider being a TA for your own course. Being available to answer students questions both gives you first-hand knowledge of those questions and provides extra support to your other TAs.

  * An online course is live 24 hours of the day, 7 days a week for the entire length of the course. Will you have TAs available at all times? Will you restrict TAs to certain time periods?

  * Where will you get your TAs from? If your course is international or multi-cultural, consider having TAs that the represent multiple groups. At the very least, have TAs in multiple time zones.

  * Consider the breakdown in expertise of your TAs. Will you expect all TAs to know the same amount? Will you have a set of first-line TAs who mainly handle administrative questions? Will you have second-line TAs who are more expert in the course material? We found in Power Searching with Google that the majority of student questions concerned course administration, rather than course content. TAs with little content knowledge could answer those questions, leaving the difficult content questions for TAs or experts with more  familiarity with the content.

  * Think of the backup staff you will need, in case of sickness or whatever emergency comes up.

  * Create a calendar of TA dates in advance, including the expected commitment in terms of total number of  hours, during what hours you most want coverage, and when events (release of units or assessments, hangouts, ...) will happen. See [Example Event Timeline & TA Hours](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Arvsi5kPl6d8dGZkZDNCbEVNT1BGQ2dzWnlNczNsdEE).

  * For a large audience that requires significant TA support, consider having someone dedicated to taking care of all things related to TA setup.  In that case, pass them a checklist of to-do’s as a starting point, covering the things described here.

## Escalation ##

TAs won't be able to handle all questions that they receive. They need to be able to escalate to appropriate people. The easiest way to do this is with multiple email aliases:

  * **help@** for students to send questions to TAs. Make this the **only** email alias available to students. Depending on the specific question, messages may get forwarded to other aliases.
  * **expert-help@** for TAs to escalate student content-related questions. Only available to course staff.
  * **tech-help@** for TAs to escalate student technical issues (such as login problems and other troubleshooting). Only available to course staff.

Recruit willing and enthusiastic helpers for these support email aliases. For escalated questions, TAs can continue serve as the interface with users, relaying the solutions and closing out requests in a friendly, helpful manner.

Note that you may choose to not make a help email address available to students. Instead, you may force students to do all of their written communication with course staff through the discussion forum. Even if you do this, consider having the help@ email alias and have that alias get copies of all messages sent to the web forum. Doing so makes it easier to forward problematic posts to the escalation lists.

## TA training ##

Your TAs need to be familiar with both the content of the course and how to be a TA for an online course. Depending on their level of experience, you may choose to provide training for them in either or both of those areas. Some tips:

  * Have TAs go through the entire course before it opens to students, preferably with the final version that the students see.
  * If you use TAs to pilot early drafts of the course, still make the final material available to them before it is available to students.
  * Before the course starts, require TAs to attend a hands-on demo of moderating the forum. What should they do when they encounter a question they don't know how to answer? When a question has been asked many times? When a question is abusive or otherwise spam? And so on.
  * If your course content works differently for different parts of your audience, make sure your TAs are aware of that fact, so that they don't misrepresent the material. For example, some aspects of Google Search functionality are available in only some countries. If your TAs think their personal experience is the only one, they may confuse students with inaccurate explanations.

## TA community ##

Just like your course will be more successful if the students form a support community among themselves, it will be more successful if the TAs can also form a community. The following tips help create that feeling of community:
  * If you have multiple TAs on duty at the same time:
    * Encourage them to be in close communication with each other. Questions come in waves; it's common for there to be a frequently-asked question at a particular time. Sharing information about problems and solutions eases the TA work.
    * If most of your TAs are physically near each other, get a single room for them to meet in during their TA shifts.
    * If your TAs are physically distributed, have all TAs on duty at the same time enter the same [group chat](http://support.google.com/chat/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=161886).
    * Don't force your TAs to participate in these group sessions, but do encourage them to attend at least one, to get a feel for what goes on during a shift.

  * Schedule TAs with overlapping shifts or encourage them to pass on highlights of what happened in the last shift to the new shift.

  * TAs often feel more comfortable checking with each other before escalating questions to more expert advice. New TAs tend to be less confident and may need help to getting started.

  * Create a buddy system for your TAs, so the more experienced can help the less experienced. Here, "experience" can be either experience at being a TA or experience in the subject matter.

  * Consider sending out “Daily Highlights” or starting a blog to keep TAs informed about the latest course happenings, and call out success stories regularly to keep everyone motivated.

## TA documentation ##

The more documentation you provide your TAs, the more self-sufficient they can be. Centralize all of the documentation in one place that can be searched; consider creating a Google Site for TA resources. Make the information editable by the TAs themselves, so that they can add information as the course progresses.

Topics to include:

  * Information about the course itself
    * Audience
    * Objectives
    * Logistical details (How many units? When will they be released? How long is each? ...)
    * Link to the course so the TAs can go through the material themselves

  * Announcements to students
    * Official messaging to students on various decisions, such as the mid-course assessment due date
    * Answers to commonly-asked questions (and add to these answers while the course is ongoing)

  * TA Roles and responsibilities
    * Before the course
      * Learn what the TAs need to do
      * Play a role in testing and development (if applicable)
      * Prepare to communicate with the public
        * What tone should they take in posts?
        * Are there  things to stress or to omit?
        * Are there legal issues they should be aware of ?
      * Prepare for moderating the forum
        * If an official message has been sent to students, don't contradict it or add your own messaging
        * Are there messages that should not be responded to? How will they know?
        * What indicates that a message should be removed from the forum?
        * How do you mark a post as a duplicate?
    * During the course
      * Ensure round-the-clock student support (or whatever coverage you decide is appropriate)
      * Moderate the forum by following communication protocols agreed upon by all TAs
      * Add further responses and anticipated questions to the TA answer guide
    * After the course
      * Debrief as a group
      * When do you plan to stop communicating with your students and stop providing support? That is, when will you turn off the course forums?
      * Document how you did what you did
      * Prepare useful tools to help the next round of TAs
      * Add documentation about what students saw that needs fixing or can be improved for the next time around

  * Team and support staff
    * Who is involved in this project?
    * What are their roles?
    * How do TAs contact them for answering questions?

  * Hot topics
    * What are students asking about?

  * Happy topics
    * What great things are students accomplishing in the course?
    * What positive comments have been received?
    * TA success stories
    * News or publicity mentions

## Close communication ##

In addition to the formal documentation or training you do for your TAs, strive for close communication with them both before and during the course.

  * Set up an internal email alias for the TA team.

  * Throughout the course, keep TAs informed on course developments, breaking news, shifts in strategies, and so on. In essence, make sure they feel part of the team delivering the course.

  * Keep emails to TAs concise and don’t send too many small details or too much to read. You want them to feel included, not overwhelmed.

  * As described in [TA community](#TA_community.md) put out a daily summary for TAs on any updates and changes.  Include information such as the most popular questions asked by students that day and what their responses should be. Also include ongoing data, such as the number of registrants and their progress. The first type of information helps them assist better; the second type improves their motivation.

  * Be open to your TAs’ insights on how to improve the course.  As the active interface between the course and your students, TAs have firsthand experience with the students and can often provide you with important feedback.

  * At the end of the course, conduct a debrief with your TAs to gather information you can use to improve the experience next time.

## Tips when moderating a forum ##

  * You'll find that students ask the same question many times. There are a couple of techniques for handling this:
    * In your forum, choose one instance of the question as the main question. Mark all other instances of that question as duplicates. Point the duplicates to the main questions.
    * Create a "canned response" for the question. That is, answer the question once and put that answer somewhere the other TAs will look. Then all TAs can copy and paste the same answer when the question comes back.
  * Prioritize the questions you respond to; you don't have to respond to everything.
  * Encourage students to answer each other.
  * Consider waiting a while before posting, to give students an opportunity to answer their peers, but do respond if the information being passed around is problematic.
  * Try and give hints rather than full answers, so that the questioner has a chance to learn in the process.
  * Admit mistakes -- you'd be amazed how long people spend trying to justify incorrect course material.
  * Trust your instincts (TAs tend to be hesitant).
