# Student Assessments #

Student assessments measure student skill level and improvement in ability. Course Builder stores information about students' assessment scores, allowing you to answer questions such as:

  * What were the average scores on the different assessments?
  * Did they improve?
  * What percentage of students had a score higher than 70% on questions around a particular topic?

To get the assessment information, follow the instructions in [ExportCourseData](ExportCourseData.md) to download the **Student** data as a CSV file.

For an example of how to use student assessments and reach and engagement data to evaluate your course's effectiveness, see [Combine Assessment and Reach Data](AnalyticsForEdu.md).
