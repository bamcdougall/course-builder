<h1>Course Builder Checklists</h1>



Course Builder is an Open Source (Apache 2.0), online education platform. Use it to create your online course whether it's for an entire university offering, professional training, or a corporate product.  Course Builder:
  * has a [rich feature set](FeatureList.md)
  * massively scales because it runs on Google infrastructure
  * has a free tier
  * supports multiple courses on the same instance (multitenancy)
  * support for Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager
  * requires no programming to create or run your course
  * is relatively quick to get up and running

## Download and install ##
All pathnames are relative to the directory containing Course Builder.

  1. Download and install  [Python](http://python.org/download). You may already have it. Check to ensure it is Python version 2.7.x.
  1. Download and install [App Engine](Download#Download_and_install_Google_App_Engine.md).
  1. Download the latest version of the [Course Builder](https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/wiki/DownloadCourseBuilder?tm=2). Course Builder supports Windows 7, Mac, and Linux.

## Deploy to Google App Engine ##
You must deploy the Course Builder app before you can make permanent changes to it. When you first deploy, you use the example **Power Searching with Google** course. After deployment, you can use this example course as a template or completely start a new, empty course.

  1. [Register your app (course) with Google](UploadCode#Register_your_app_(course)_with_Google.md)
  1. [Set up an app-specific password](UploadCode#Set_up_an_app-specific_password.md)
  1. [Upload (or deploy) your app](UploadCode#Upload_(or_deploy)_your_app.md)
  1. [Set Up Security](UploadCode#Set_Up_Security.md)

## Create your course ##
You can create a new, empty course or import the example course and use it as a template. New courses are by default private: only the technologist(s) who created the course(s) can see it.

  1. [Create a course](CreateNewCourse.md)
  1. [Import Data into an Empty Course](CreateNewCourse#Import_Data_into_an_Empty_Course.md)
